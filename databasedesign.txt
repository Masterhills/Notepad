Database design one to many relationships

A table represents objects, tables are created to store data
-STEPS
1. What is one to many relationship?
 A relationship between two or more tables in which one record in one table is related to many records in another table
example A relationship between customer and an order table, a customer can have many orders
but an order can belong to a single customer that is why it is a one to many relationships
another example is the relationship between cars and showrooms. A showroom can have multiple cars but a car 
cannot have multiple showrooms.

2. Write down what you want to store in a sentence
	-Store the customer information and the orders that they have made
	-Store the car and the showroom they are located in

3.Write down the objects from this sentence
	-identify the words that describe objects in this sentence
	-objects are basically nouns that refer to things
	Examples customers, orders from the sentence above
		cars and showroom
4. Determine if the relationship is a one to many relationship
	Does object1 have many object2s or does Object2 have many object1s
	so does a customer have many orders or does an order have many customers

5.Create a diagram with these tables
