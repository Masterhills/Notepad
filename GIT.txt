GIT and GIThub
Git is a version control system that allows one or more people work on the same project
Github is a hosting platform that helps us host our project in a cloud.
Github is a platform for hosting and collaborating on git repositories
How Git works?
we have the staging area and commit history
we use git add to add file to staging area
we use git commit to move the file from the staging area to commit history

Git init is used for creating a create git repository in the folder. It can only be used on a new project and not an existing one
A commit is basically a safe point
the staging area process and commit is done on your local machine so when your machine 
dies(power failure) the changes are lost so it is best to store your changes in a remote server that 
is where github comes into place

how to delete a folder from the git bash terminal
rm -rf .git
how to remove a file from the staging area
git restore --staged file
how to stage files that are in a folder
git add -A
how to correct your commit message(on your last commit)
git commit --amend -m"correcting commit message"
GIT Push: it helps to store your git project or push the projects from your local machine to the remote server
GIT STATUS: it gives you the information of files that have been staged or unstaged
GIT COMMIT:git commit -m "new project"
git diff: it gives you the difference in what you have in the current working directory and what has been committed

creating a repository
HOW TO TAKE FILES FROM YOUR LOCAL MACHINE TO A REMOTE SERVER
git push
how to get files from your remote server to your local machine
git pull
HOW TO INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY TO BE A GIT ONE 
git init

Reason why we create a ssh key is to be able to have access to our github through the terminal(git bash) on our local machine
generate a private and public key and upload the public key in our account and with our private key we can push to this repository

main and master branch mean the same thing
main and master branch are default branch
A BRANCH represents an independent line of development

How to create a branch?
TO KNOW THE BRANCH you are on--git branch
TO know the branch you are on, on the remote server -- git branch -r or git branch -a(to list all the branch you are on both remote and locally)
To create a new branch -- git branch feature-a( A BRANCH named feature-a)
To switch to a new branch -- git checkout feature-a(To switch to feature-a branch)
To switch to the previous branch --git checkout - 
To push files on a new branch to a remote server(github): git push -u origin feature-a(pushing the feature-a branch to github)
How to switch directly to a new branch while simultaneously creating a new branch -- git checkout -b to-delete(switching to a new branch to-delete)
How to delete a branch: git branch -d to-delete(this is to delete the to-delete branch)

HOW TO MERGE IN GIT?
git merge feature-a(merging the feature-a branch to the main branch on the main branch)

How to merge a branch through a pull request?
