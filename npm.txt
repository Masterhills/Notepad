 NPM
Node package manager: it is javascript package(modules/libraries) manager
it also makes it to share and reuse code
npmjs.com it is a repository for npm modules. 
It showcases the docs for each package, how to install their github links and etc

Package.json file
it has all your application info
It holds a list of your application dependencies(the modules that your application needs to work)
It doesn't just hold the names the dependencies. it also list the specific version of the modules that it uses
The file is created using --  npm init
				npm init --yes or npm init -y
To modify the package.json file
for example modifying the name of the author

		npm config set init-author-name "Lawrence"
		npm set init-license "mit"

To see the data of the package.json file through terminal
		npm get init-author-name
		npm config get init-author-name

To delete information from the package.json file
		npm config delete init-author-name
		npm config delete init-license

to install a module and save it to your package.json file as a dependency 
	to install the module lodash and save it to the package.json file as a dependency

			npm install lodash --save
what the --save does is it helps install the required module needed by an application to work
so if the app having the package.json file where the dependency is listed then when you install npm
using npm install it automtically installs the module on the dependency.
you can now run the app using node

DEV DEPENDNECY(IT is used for development and not production)
gulp a task runner that is used to minify your javascript and compile sass files

for example installing the the gulp dev dependency 
		npm install gulp gulp-sass --save-dev

           
		npm install --production
the production flag when used along side installing the module does not install the dev dependencies. it only
installs the dependencies.
		npm install 
	will add the dependencies including the dev dependencies


--Uninstalling or Removing dependencies

	 npm uninstall gulp-sass --save-dev 
	npm remove gulp --save-dev

Installing global modules

	npm install -g nodemon

to uninstall/remove global modules
