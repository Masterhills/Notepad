MEASURING ALGORITHM EFFICIENCY WITH BIG-O

Big-o is measuring how code slows as data grows.
It is about how the running time changes as the data size changes
To develop faster algorithms it is important to understand Big-O
Big O is a notation that describes the order of growth of an algorithm. The lower the order of growth, the better.
